# EDA
A large-scale project in Exploratory Data Analysis embedded with Machine Learning algorithms executed in a menu-based UI in Python.
The library TKinter is used to create the UI.

The project has 3 main modules:
1.Analysis - Text based analysis
2.Visualization of data
3.Machine Learning Algorithms
A fourth model is used as an experimental module which predicts which predicts which metrics are categorical variables and which are numerical.

Each module has multiple capabilities, namely:
-Analysis:
  Peek
  Data Dimensions
  Attribute data types
  Descriptive Statistics
  Correlation
  Skew
  Class Distribution
-Visualization:
  --2D visualization: 
    Plot graph 
    Histogram
    Correlation matrix
    Pie Chart
    Bar Graph
    Kernel Density Plot
    Violin Plot
  --3D visualization:
    Scatter Plot
    Pairwise scatter plot
    Bubble Chart
    Hue
    Kernel Density Plot
-ML Algorithms:
  Regression
  Support Vector Machine
  Neural Network
  K-means clustering
  Load Model
